# Barcode-Scanner

Barcode Scanner App is my third project. The app allows users to scan barcodes. When appropriate code was scanned, users can find information about the product. If the information is not available users, can manually insert product details. The product is stored in their favorite product's bucket that is stored safely in AWS Cloud Data Store. Therefore app will recognize the barcode when scanned again.
Technology used:
- SwiftUI
- UIKit integration
- AVFoundation
- Network Calls
- CocoaPods integration
- Integration with AWS Amplify, Data Store
- Barcode APIs

Development in progress. Will update video presenting the app shortly:)
